========Brief about Mobile Education=========
With the wide-spread usage of the mobile phones, it has become  an omnipresent technology with everyone. Leveraging on this  fact, this forum intends to better education using the SMS  technology. For SMS no high-end mobiles are required, even basic  model mobile-phones support SMS, and no internet.<br /> Most  students fail the metric test or the 10th standard exam as they  are the first board (state-level) exams and after the failure  they drop education as it seems like a very huge barrier to  cross for further growth. Keeping this in mind here is a small  app to get exam tips on the mobile phone using SMS service.
